[19:14:15] [Server thread/INFO]: <ndrwhr> What did you do to my skeletons
[19:14:25] [Server thread/INFO]: <DarthAwesomous1> I was just about to ask the same
[19:14:33] [Server thread/INFO]: <DarthAwesomous1> they were there earlier
[19:14:42] [Server thread/INFO]: <ndrwhr> they probably killed each other
[19:14:55] [Server thread/INFO]: <ndrwhr> Did you find the villager in the wall?
[19:15:01] [Server thread/INFO]: <DarthAwesomous1> ya

[19:15:57] [Server thread/INFO]: <ndrwhr> the top of the mountain
[19:16:55] [Server thread/INFO]: <DarthAwesomous1> wanna go check out the nether later?
[19:17:06] [Server thread/INFO]: <ndrwhr> Yeah, we should make a wither
[19:17:53] [Server thread/INFO]: <ndrwhr> I made a bunch of nether bricks
[19:18:02] [Server thread/INFO]: <DarthAwesomous1> ya, I saw that
[19:18:09] [Server thread/INFO]: <DarthAwesomous1> we should find some nether ward
[19:18:17] [Server thread/INFO]: <ndrwhr> what is that?
[19:22:11] [Server thread/INFO]: <DarthAwesomous1> sorry, nether wart
[19:22:19] [Server thread/INFO]: Given [Nether Wart] * 64 to DarthAwesomous1
[19:22:29] [Server thread/INFO]: <ndrwhr> boom
[19:22:42] [Server thread/INFO]: <DarthAwesomous1> what?
[19:22:52] [Server thread/INFO]: <ndrwhr> check your inventory
[19:23:16] [Server thread/INFO]: <DarthAwesomous1> are you just cheating?
[19:23:29] [Server thread/INFO]: <DarthAwesomous1> that honestly kind of makes this game pointless
[19:23:30] [Server thread/INFO]: <ndrwhr> no I'm user server commands
[19:23:52] [Server thread/INFO]: <DarthAwesomous1> ya, that's cheating
[19:23:59] [Server thread/INFO]: <ndrwhr> I've only used it for weird things, like villagers and skeletons
[19:24:18] [Server thread/INFO]: <DarthAwesomous1> ya, that's fine, but don't start calling up items
[19:24:28] [Server thread/INFO]: <ndrwhr> yeah
[19:24:46] [Server thread/INFO]: <ndrwhr> go throw that nether rack away, let's go find some
[19:25:00] [Server thread/INFO]: <DarthAwesomous1> where'd the lava pit go?
[19:25:39] [Server thread/INFO]: <ndrwhr> I got rid of that a long time ago
[19:25:50] [Server thread/INFO]: <DarthAwesomous1> that's fine, I'll just use the one out back
[19:25:59] [Server thread/INFO]: <ndrwhr> there's the hole at the end of hall upstairs

[19:45:33] [Server thread/INFO]: <ndrwhr> look up
[19:45:45] [Server thread/INFO]: <ndrwhr> behind you
[19:45:51] [Server thread/INFO]: <ndrwhr> I'm going to head this way
[19:47:26] [Server thread/INFO]: <DarthAwesomous1> shit, how do we get back?
[19:47:35] [Server thread/INFO]: <ndrwhr> I remeber
[19:47:39] [Server thread/INFO]: <DarthAwesomous1> ok
[19:47:44] [Server thread/INFO]: <DarthAwesomous1> don't let me get lost
[19:52:37] [Server thread/INFO]: <ndrwhr> why do the pig men not attack right away
[19:52:49] [Server thread/INFO]: <DarthAwesomous1> theyre neutral unless you attack them
[19:53:05] [Server thread/INFO]: <DarthAwesomous1> why is there a chicken down here?
[19:54:21] [Server thread/INFO]: DarthAwesomous1 was burnt to a crisp whilst fighting Ghast
[19:54:26] [Server thread/INFO]: <DarthAwesomous1> fuck
[19:56:39] [Server thread/INFO]: <DarthAwesomous1> did you grab my stuff?
[19:56:54] [Server thread/INFO]: <ndrwhr> yup
[19:57:15] [Server thread/INFO]: <DarthAwesomous1> thanks
[19:57:48] [Server thread/INFO]: <DarthAwesomous1> is it possible to build a nether portal down in the nether?
[19:58:33] [Server thread/INFO]: <DarthAwesomous1> where the hell did you come from?
[19:58:43] [Server thread/INFO]: <ndrwhr> the nether
[19:58:48] [Server thread/INFO]: <DarthAwesomous1> lol
[19:58:54] [Server thread/INFO]: <ndrwhr> I started heading back after i got your stuff
[19:59:26] [Server thread/INFO]: <DarthAwesomous1> lets build another portal somewhere else
[19:59:35] [Server thread/INFO]: <ndrwhr> Up stairs?
[20:00:11] [Server thread/INFO]: <DarthAwesomous1> I think that where you come out in the nether is related to where the portal is placed in the overwo
[20:00:17] [Server thread/INFO]: <DarthAwesomous1> overworld*
[20:00:29] [Server thread/INFO]: <ndrwhr> huh, well let's go build it on top of a mountain
[20:01:27] [Server thread/INFO]: <ndrwhr> do you have everything we need?
[20:02:44] [Server thread/INFO]: <DarthAwesomous1> ya
[20:03:54] [Server thread/INFO]: <ndrwhr> we should go build something inside of the mountain just outside the base
[20:04:04] [Server thread/INFO]: <ndrwhr> i've always wanted to hollow out a mountain
[20:04:37] [Server thread/INFO]: <DarthAwesomous1> shit, I had so much experience from down there
[20:04:53] [Server thread/INFO]: <ndrwhr> Oh that reminds me, I'm going to enchant some shit
[20:05:00] [Server thread/INFO]: <DarthAwesomous1> ya, good call
[20:05:08] [Server thread/INFO]: <ndrwhr> but I'm thinking that mountain that I'm looking towards
[20:05:18] [Server thread/INFO]: <DarthAwesomous1> the dirt hill?
[20:05:22] [Server thread/INFO]: <ndrwhr> yes
[20:05:28] [Server thread/INFO]: <DarthAwesomous1> sounds good
[20:05:47] [Server thread/INFO]: <DarthAwesomous1> although I think it would still be better to put a portal on top of the mountain
[20:07:19] [Server thread/INFO]: <ndrwhr> Oh I have your boots still
[20:07:38] [Server thread/INFO]: <DarthAwesomous1> oh, shit, i just made some more
[20:07:47] [Server thread/INFO]: <DarthAwesomous1> i'm just going to breed some cows
[20:07:59] [Server thread/INFO]: <ndrwhr> oh, yeah lets build the portal on top of the mountain
[20:09:59] [Server thread/INFO]: <DarthAwesomous1> oh, shit, that's how you make nether bricks?
[20:10:04] [Server thread/INFO]: <ndrwhr> yeah
[20:10:12] [Server thread/INFO]: <ndrwhr> then you put them together in blocks of 4
[20:10:18] [Server thread/INFO]: <DarthAwesomous1> ya
[20:10:25] [Server thread/INFO]: <ndrwhr> Let's go build a shrine on top of the mountain
[20:10:33] [Server thread/INFO]: <DarthAwesomous1> ok, allons-y
[20:11:05] [Server thread/INFO]: <ndrwhr> totally looking up your skirt

[20:12:18] [Server thread/INFO]: <DarthAwesomous1> I wanted to build a platform
[20:13:41] [Server thread/INFO]: <DarthAwesomous1> give me some nether bricks
[20:14:19] [Server thread/INFO]: DarthAwesomous1 fell from a high place
[20:14:54] [Server thread/INFO]: <DarthAwesomous1> I should really get some boots with featherfall on them
