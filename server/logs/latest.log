[18:54:56] [Server thread/INFO]: <DarthAwesomous1> the rocket is made with paper and gunpowder
[18:55:23] [Server thread/INFO]: <DarthAwesomous1> but you need to make a charge to go on top, which is gunpowder, some sort of dye
[18:55:35] [Server thread/INFO]: <DarthAwesomous1> and glowstone, or a feather or some other stuff

[20:03:08] [Server thread/INFO]: <ndrwhr> I was thinking we could build a sweet railroad over to the desert
[20:03:22] [Server thread/INFO]: <DarthAwesomous1> we'll need more iron
[20:03:43] [Server thread/INFO]: <ndrwhr> Theres that mine right outside the grey havens

[20:17:24] [Server thread/INFO]: <DarthAwesomous1> did you just go through the whole thing dropping torches?
[20:17:30] [Server thread/INFO]: <ndrwhr> Pretty much
[20:17:42] [Server thread/INFO]: <ndrwhr> I guess there isn't as much here as I once thought
[20:17:57] [Server thread/INFO]: <DarthAwesomous1> eh, I'm sure we just have to dig a bit
[20:18:02] [Server thread/INFO]: <ndrwhr> I ran out of torches once, so I thought there must be more, but I was really close to the end
[20:18:16] [Server thread/INFO]: <ndrwhr> There's one area where I can hear zombies but it's at a dead end
[20:18:29] [Server thread/INFO]: <DarthAwesomous1> lets dig through
[20:19:58] [Server thread/INFO]: <DarthAwesomous1> what's with all the chickens down here?
[20:20:03] [Server thread/INFO]: <ndrwhr> No idea
[20:22:38] [Server thread/INFO]: <DarthAwesomous1> and you know what, I've picked up a decent amount of coal and iron so far
[20:22:51] [Server thread/INFO]: <ndrwhr> yeah I've got 21 iron so far
[20:23:20] [Server thread/INFO]: <ndrwhr> I think I'm going to run it back before digging for the zombies
[20:23:29] [Server thread/INFO]: <DarthAwesomous1> ok, sounds good
[20:23:36] [Server thread/INFO]: <DarthAwesomous1> wait for me at the base as i try and get out
[20:25:39] [Server thread/INFO]: <DarthAwesomous1> I want to make some armor and stuff
[20:27:10] [Server thread/INFO]: <ndrwhr> We could also just go on another boat adventure and try to find some snow
[20:27:36] [Server thread/INFO]: <DarthAwesomous1> that'd be cool. now that I won't have to worry as much about running into stuff
[20:28:01] [Server thread/INFO]: <ndrwhr> I'm going to upgrade our map to the max
[20:28:33] [Server thread/INFO]: <DarthAwesomous1> I had one that was a high level, but apparently I lost it
[20:29:06] [Server thread/INFO]: <ndrwhr> I have a map #10 right now
[20:29:44] [Server thread/INFO]: <DarthAwesomous1> cool
[20:29:53] [Server thread/INFO]: <DarthAwesomous1> want to make me a copy as well?
[20:29:59] [Server thread/INFO]: <DarthAwesomous1> I have a compass already
[20:32:24] [Server thread/INFO]: <DarthAwesomous1> do we need another map?
[20:32:39] [Server thread/INFO]: <ndrwhr> Um I have one
[20:32:48] [Server thread/INFO]: <ndrwhr> If you want one of your own we could probably make one
[20:32:49] [Server thread/INFO]: <DarthAwesomous1> just one though?
[20:32:58] [Server thread/INFO]: <ndrwhr> Yeah make another I guess
[20:33:53] [Server thread/INFO]: <ndrwhr> I have a shit ton of paper if you're looking for some
[20:34:02] [Server thread/INFO]: <DarthAwesomous1> oh...
[20:34:08] [Server thread/INFO]: <ndrwhr> I just dumped it in the food box
[20:34:45] [Server thread/INFO]: <DarthAwesomous1> ok
[20:34:46] [Server thread/INFO]: <ndrwhr> I have clock for you
[20:35:00] [Server thread/INFO]: <DarthAwesomous1> sweet!
[20:37:20] [Server thread/INFO]: <ndrwhr> I'm going to assume it was you who organized all of the boxes...?
[20:38:01] [Server thread/INFO]: <DarthAwesomous1> ya
[20:38:22] [Server thread/INFO]: <DarthAwesomous1> the map numbering is weird
[20:38:31] [Server thread/INFO]: <ndrwhr> Yeah I have no idea what is going on
[20:38:46] [Server thread/INFO]: <DarthAwesomous1> it says i have a map #16
[20:38:53] [Server thread/INFO]: <DarthAwesomous1> but it was level 4
[20:38:59] [Server thread/INFO]: <DarthAwesomous1> and now I can't improve it
[20:39:00] [Server thread/INFO]: <ndrwhr> So apparently we have created 16 maps...?
[20:39:24] [Server thread/INFO]: <ndrwhr> I think they count from 0 - 4 in terms of size
[20:39:33] [Server thread/INFO]: <DarthAwesomous1> oh, ok
[20:40:19] [Server thread/INFO]: <DarthAwesomous1> ready?
[20:40:24] [Server thread/INFO]: <ndrwhr> yeah
[20:40:30] [Server thread/INFO]: <ndrwhr> to the grey havens
[20:41:26] [Server thread/INFO]: <DarthAwesomous1> I'm out in the bay
[20:41:38] [Server thread/INFO]: <DarthAwesomous1> whoa, what's the glass thing in the side of the hill?
[20:42:19] [Server thread/INFO]: <ndrwhr> that's my secret project
[20:42:23] [Server thread/INFO]: <DarthAwesomous1> I can see so far!
[20:42:24] [Server thread/INFO]: <ndrwhr> that's not so secret
[20:43:51] [Server thread/INFO]: <ndrwhr> There's pigs and horses there
[20:43:56] [Server thread/INFO]: <DarthAwesomous1> should we stop to gather stuff along the way?
[20:44:08] [Server thread/INFO]: <ndrwhr> We can
[20:44:18] [Server thread/INFO]: <ndrwhr> or we can see how far this goes
[20:45:13] [Server thread/INFO]: <DarthAwesomous1> that cave doesn't go anywhere
[20:46:53] [Server thread/INFO]: <DarthAwesomous1> sorry
[20:48:07] [Server thread/INFO]: <DarthAwesomous1> where'd you end up?
[20:48:18] [Server thread/INFO]: <ndrwhr> I was just going to ask where you are
[20:48:27] [Server thread/INFO]: <ndrwhr> I'll head back to the boat
[20:48:45] [Server thread/INFO]: <DarthAwesomous1> i'm back in teh boat
[20:49:29] [Server thread/INFO]: <DarthAwesomous1> I'm over by the big tall lava column
[20:56:19] [Server thread/INFO]: <DarthAwesomous1> fuck
[20:56:22] [Server thread/INFO]: <ndrwhr> I think we did a pretty good job
[20:56:23] [Server thread/INFO]: <DarthAwesomous1> that was crazy
[20:56:46] [Server thread/INFO]: <ndrwhr> Do you want to go check out that sand hill?
[20:56:55] [Server thread/INFO]: <DarthAwesomous1> the temple?
[20:57:17] [Server thread/INFO]: <ndrwhr> That's one way to mine sand
[20:57:25] [Server thread/INFO]: <ndrwhr> That's the temple that I blew up by accident
[20:57:30] [Server thread/INFO]: <DarthAwesomous1> lol, by creeper?
[20:59:48] [Server thread/INFO]: <ndrwhr> No, the one that fell in when you were looking at it

[21:00:20] [Server thread/INFO]: <DarthAwesomous1> ya, sorry I meant mining sand by creeper

[21:03:05] [Server thread/INFO]: <ndrwhr> Nice, let's build a chest to leave in this town
[21:03:17] [Server thread/INFO]: <DarthAwesomous1> i was just thinking that
[21:03:56] [Server thread/INFO]: <ndrwhr> Do you have a crafting table?
[21:04:07] [Server thread/INFO]: <DarthAwesomous1> ya
[21:05:22] [Server thread/INFO]: <ndrwhr> I had a glass bottle

[21:09:22] [Server thread/INFO]: <DarthAwesomous1> lol, I'm surprised you didn't die
[21:09:23] [Server thread/INFO]: <ndrwhr> we could have easily been fucked
[21:09:30] [Server thread/INFO]: <DarthAwesomous1> you had so many arrows coming out of you
[21:09:36] [Server thread/INFO]: <ndrwhr> lol so did you
[21:09:51] [Server thread/INFO]: <ndrwhr> My armor is a little worse for ware
[21:10:05] [Server thread/INFO]: <DarthAwesomous1> mine is still pretty good
[21:11:40] [Server thread/INFO]: <ndrwhr> Zombie died in the well
[21:13:31] [Server thread/INFO]: <DarthAwesomous1> wait, does blocking with the sword stop arrows?

[21:50:55] [Server thread/INFO]: <DarthAwesomous1> I'm by the mouth of the cave
[21:51:39] [Server thread/INFO]: <DarthAwesomous1> by the sand penis
[21:52:49] [Server thread/INFO]: <DarthAwesomous1> well that was anti climactic

[21:59:41] [Server thread/INFO]: <DarthAwesomous1> how should we go about finishing?
[21:59:54] [Server thread/INFO]: <DarthAwesomous1> If I quit in this cave, will I spawn here next time?
[21:59:55] [Server thread/INFO]: <ndrwhr> We should probably head back to our main base
